How It Works
1. User Input: Prompts for image URL with demo fallback option
2. Validation: Checks URL format and safety parameters
3. Connection: Uses proper User-Agent headers for respectful scraping
4. Verification: Validates content type and file size
5. Duplicate Check: Compares MD5 hashes to prevent duplicates
6. Storage: Saves images with appropriate filenames
7. Feedback: Provides clear success/error messages
